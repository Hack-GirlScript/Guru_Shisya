# Guru_Shisya

Guru Shishya is a platform that will bridge the gap between knowledgeable Teachers and Students who are curious to learn.

We know that our country is evoloving every single day. But there still exist some community which does not allow women to go out or to make their own identity.

Education is the only key that will bring the awareness about how important it is for women to shine and make their own identity. Our platform will be a medium for them to shine and rise.

Guru Shisya will help women who have knowledge but are not allowed to go out or the one's who is pregnent but wants to make her maternity leave productive by sharing her knowledge from her home itself, with curious students or the one's having health issues. They can teach the subject of their choice. Apart from all this, we also help learners by providing a heavy bunch of resources.

We will be uploading the specifications of every teacher on 'Know Your Teacher' section. Students can easily get to know about every teacher on our platform.

## We are just acting as a bridge between Teacher and Student.
